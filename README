outline-client (cross-platform VPN or proxy client via Shadowsocks)
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Here's how to install outline-client on Slackware.


First, fetch the Outline-Client.AppImage:

https://github.com/Jigsaw-Code/outline-client/releases/download/linux-v1.0.9/Outline-Client.AppImage


Then, with this AppImage in the same directory as the
outline-client.SlackBuild script, run the script as root to convert the
AppImage to a Slackware .txz:

VERSION=1.0.9 ./outline-client.SlackBuild

Change the VERSION value to the same release number as the package as
needed.

This will produce a Slackware compatible .txz package.  The exact
version number in the package filename will depend on the version of
Outline-Client specified, but it will be something like:
outline-client-1.0.9-x86_64-1zakame.txz

You'll find the output package in the /tmp directory.


Then, install the package (again as root):

cd /tmp
upgradepkg --install-new outline-client-1.0.9-x86_64-1zakame.txz

Do note that this installs the OutlineProxyController daemon, but you
need to start it before running the outline-client application:

chmod +x /etc/rc.d/rc.outline-proxy
/etc/rc.d/rc.outline-proxy start


Enjoy!  :-)
